Thank you for viewing the English translation patch for the Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, created by the Anime Game Translations Team!

Before you can play the translation, you’ll need to patch the game on your computer using a legal copy of the ROM.

===

Instructions

-Run ‘DeltaPatcherLite.exe’ found in the patch folder. (Alternatively download at https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/)
-‘Original file’ should be your copy of the ROM, as an ‘.nds’ filetype.
-For ‘XDelta patch’, choose the ‘GurrenLagannPatch.xdelta’ file.
-Hit apply patch, and you’re good to go!

Play this file on an emulator such as DeSmuME, or use a flashcart to play it on any member of the NDS family.

We hope you enjoy!

Changes to the game

A compiled list of bug fixes/tweaks that were made to the original ROM.

-Added a cheat code to unlock the hidden debug menu when starting a new game from an empty slot
-Edited the spacing of the battle result text (“Victory”, “Defeat” & “Draw”) to be closer together to read better in English
-Swapped the names of skills 077 “Combustion Reaching To Heaven” & 078 “Combustion Of Bro’s Thoughts” (stamp minigames) around to fit better with their quotes
-Re-added a hidden conversation with Dayakka in Chapter 04 (Gurren Emerges!!) Note: it displays with the "!?" normally reserved for battles, and doesn’t change after speaking with him
-Fixed an issue with cut-in images flashing up, then disappearing in Chapter 17 (What The Hell Is “Civilisation”!?)

Translation Notes for New Content

The game features some exclusive content for which no official translation is available. Some names which may previously have been known to fans through the Nyoro~n Subs translation of the OVA (also known as Episode 5.5), characters ‘Chitori’ and ‘Jigitalis’, as well as the Gunmen ‘Daorek’ and ‘Usaggon’, have been changed to ‘Tetori’, ‘Ziggitalis’, ‘Zaolegg’ and ‘Usappyon’ respectively, following abbreviations found in the game files. (It should be noted that these too are approximations, as the game files are by no means consistent.)

The joke lost in translation; ‘Usapyon’ doubles as a slang for “Just kidding!” as well as a combination of the words usagi (rabbit) and pyon (onomatopoeia for a hopping noise), hence why Kamina names the Gunman “Usappyon” seeing its rabbit-like appearance.
