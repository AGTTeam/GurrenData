Changes to the game

A compiled list of bug fixes/tweaks that were made to the original ROM.

-Added a cheat code to unlock the hidden debug menu when starting a new game from an empty slot
-Extended text boxes and moved the message icon to allow for more space
-Edited Simon's sprite to remove his armband pre-leaving Littner (when Kamina first puts on his father's cloak and Simon catches a piece of it)
-Added new sprite animations for Dayakka, Rossiu, Old Coco, The Black Siblings, Viral, Gimmy and Darry 
-Re-added a hidden conversation with Dayakka in Chapter 04 (Gurren Emerges!!) Note: it displays with the "!?" normally reserved for battles, and doesn't change after speaking with him
-Edited the spacing of the battle result text ("Victory", "Defeat" & "Draw") to be closer together to read better in English
-Swapped the names of skills 077 "Combustion Reaching To Heaven" & 078 "Combustion Of Bro's Thoughts" (stamp minigames) around to fit better with their quotes
-Fixed an issue with cut-in images flashing up, then disappearing in Chapter 17 (What The Hell Is "Civilisation"!?)

Translation Notes for New Content

The game features some exclusive content for which there is no official translation. Some names that may have previously been known to fans through the Nyoro~n Subs translation of the OVA (Ep 5.5), characters 'Chitori' and 'Jigitalis', as well as the Gunmen 'Daorek' and 'Usaggon', have been changed to 'Tetori', 'Ziggitalis', 'Zaolegg' and 'Usappyon' respectively, following abbreviations found in the game files. (It should be noted that these too are approximations, as the game files are by no means consistent.)

The joke lost in translation; 'Usapyon' doubles as a slang for "Just kidding!" as well as a combination of the words usagi (rabbit) and pyon (onomatopoeia for a hopping noise), hence why Kamina names the Gunman "Usappyon" seeing its rabbit-like appearance.
